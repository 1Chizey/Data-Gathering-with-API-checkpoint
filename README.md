# 🌐 Data Gathering with API – Python Project

This project demonstrates how to collect data from external APIs using Python, parse the results (typically JSON), and store them for further analysis. It showcases core skills in HTTP requests, data wrangling, and working with APIs—a critical aspect of real-world data science.

---

## 📌 Objective

To retrieve, process, and store data from a public API using Python libraries such as `requests`, `json`, and `pandas`. The goal is to build a clean and reusable workflow for data ingestion from web services.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- `requests` – for API calls
- `json` – for parsing response data
- `pandas` – for converting data into tabular format
- `time` – for delay handling if needed

---

## 🔗 API Used

- **API Source**: _(Specify if known – e.g., [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), etc.)_
- API returns data in JSON format.
- Includes sample endpoints and parameters for GET requests.

📈 Workflow
API Request
Send a GET request using the requests library with required headers or parameters.

JSON Parsing
Use Python's json module to parse the response into a dictionary.

Data Normalization
Use pandas.json_normalize() or custom processing to structure the data.

Save Output
Save the final structured data into a CSV for later use.

▶️ How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/1Chizey/Data-Gathering-with-API-checkpoint.git
cd Data-Gathering-with-API-checkpoint
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python api_data.py
⚠️ Make sure you have an active internet connection and any required API keys set if the API needs authentication.

✅ Sample Output
A CSV file containing cleaned data retrieved from the API.

Sample columns: name, id, category, value, date (based on the actual API used)
